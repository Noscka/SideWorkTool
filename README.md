# SWT
Ever wanted to double the value lenght of a box but go to google and type in the equation? well SWT (Side Working Tool) is made just for this and (in the future) many more small but annoying problems while working. it is a simple program made to assist when working on projects. While it was aimed at programming projects, it can be used with anything else that has textboxes and requires writing.

## Features
 - ### Value Calculations
      THIS MODE WILL BLOCK `0-9`, `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `=`, `.`, `{backspace}`, `{enter}` WHEN ENABLED FROM ENTERTING INTO NORMAL PROGRAMS
    
    Currently this is the only feature which allows for easy calculations for values (such as form lenght and width or array size). To enable this "mode" you need to press `ctrl` + `alt` + `shift` + `k`.
    
    To use it enter a equation (Example, 1024*4) and hit `{enter}` or `=` for the output to write where the cursor is. The follow inputs are currently working: `0-9`, `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `=`, `.`, `{backspace}`, `{enter}`. once you hit `{enter}` program will exit out of the mode so you will be able to write normally again.
